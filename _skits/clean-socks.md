# Clean Socks

The Clean Sock Skit is a must-do for any patrol looking to deliver a hilarious performance during a campout. The number of Scouts involved can be tweaked a little, but I’ve found that having around 5 Scouts is ideal. Also, for Pete’s sake, use clean socks! Please!!!

Scout #5: 12 pairs please!

Scout #1: 12!? Man, you must really be clean. Why 12 pairs?

Scout #5: Well, there’s January, February, March, …
