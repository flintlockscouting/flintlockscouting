## Description

Banana Boats are a gooey and delicious campfire desert that is easy and fun for younger scouts to make. Banana Boats are cooked in tinfoil on the open fire and consist of a banana (still in its skin) split down the middle and stuffed with chocolate chips and mini marshmallows and then melted until the banana starts to carmelize. Typically they are eaten directly from their tinfoil wrapper when they cool after coming off the fire.

## Ingredient List

Required Ingredients:

- 1 small sheet tinfoil, slightly larger than your banana
- 1 banana
- chocolate chips
- mini marshmallows

## Preparation

1. As your fire goals start to die down (maybe after a campfire?) is a great time - if the goals are too hot the bananas will burn 
1. Place your banana in the center of a sheet of tinfoil
1. Split the banana down the center leaving it in its skin
1. Stuff chocolate chips & mini mashmallows into the slit, to the scout's own taste
1. Wrap the banana tightly in tinfoil, making sure no peel is visible
1. Let warm on the coals 5 minutes or so depending on heat level - since this is just heating the banana up there is no undercooking danger. 
1. Remove from coals and check - if desired melti-ness is achieved, enjoy!
