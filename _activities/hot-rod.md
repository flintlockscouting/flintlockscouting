# Hot Rod

Your challenge is to carry the **Super Mega Burn Your Face Off Hot Rod** from here to around the Turnpoint and back. This is a team work puzzle. It can only be solved if all Scouts work together.

## Setup

Scouts have one heavy board and many short ropes The only thing that can touch the Rod are the ropes – no hands, clothes, etc. Rod cannot touch the ground after the start line. If person touches the Hot Rod he must go to the1st Aid Station (Red Cross 10’ away) to be healed and come back. If Rod drops, start over.

## Solution

Several possible solutions. Fastest is to take two ropes & four people. Tie an overhand knot in the middle of the rope, slip the end under the Rod on each end. Lift and go.

## Advanced Challenge

If Scouts solve this quickly, step it up a level. Team must pass Hot Rod through a hulu hoop on the return run from the Turn Point. To solve this one, just slide at least 3x unknotted ropes under, lift , and run. At the hoop, first team drop rope, pass front of Hot Rod through, place front rope under front, and repeat for next ropes.
