# Welcome to the Flintlock District of Scouting America's Spirit of Adventure Council's Github Site!

This site is a work in progress where we are attempting to provide a github pages driven database of resources for Scouts and Scouters to collect and share ideas, and publish them on the web.

## Contributing

Contributions will be in the form of Github Markdown using tagging to help our search functionality. Anyone is free to submit a Pull Request to add more content, but we will be carefully moderating the content to ensure quality.
