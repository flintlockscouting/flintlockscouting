# BUZZ, BING, BANG 

## How to Play

The troop sits in a circle and begins counting off, substituting “buzz” for the number seven and any multiples of seven. If a mistake is made, start over with the next person. After circling twice, add to the mix by substituting the word “bing” for the number five and any multiples of five. If a mistake is made, start over at the point of the error. After circling twice, add to this mix by substituting “bang” for the number three and any multiples of three.

## Variation 

When a person makes a mistake they are eliminated.
