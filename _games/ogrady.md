# O’GRADY 

## How to Play

Troop assembles in a single line formation, facing the leader who is four or five steps in front. The leader yells commands, but the players obey commands only if O’Grady says to. If the leader commands “O’Grady says: Arms up!” all arms go up. But, if the leader calls “Arms up!” no arms should move. Players who obey that command are out of the game. As the game progresses and few players remain, the leader speeds up his commands and a player who makes the slightest false move must drop out of the game.

## Scoring  

The last Scout in the game is the winner.

## Variation

Divide the group into two facing lines. One side obeys O’Grady, the other does not. If the leader yells, “O’Grady says: About-face!” the obeying line does an about-face and the other line stands still. When the leader calls “About-face!” the second line does an about-face, but the first does not. The object is to see which line remains in the game longer.
